## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (if you wanna run the development server)
- A modern web browser with service worker support

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amalbenny/class-timetable.git
   cd class-timetable
   ```

2. Run the local development server:
   ```bash
   python3 serve.py
   ```

3. The application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:1342`

### Alternative Setup

You can also serve the files using any HTTP server of your choice:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

## Customizing Your Timetable

Edit the [time-table.js](time-table.js) file to customize your schedule:

```javascript
const timetable = {
  Monday: [
    { 
      start: "09:00", 
      end: "09:50", 
      subject: "Mathematics", 
      type: "theory" 
    },
    // Add more periods...
  ],
  // Add more days...
};
```

### Period Types

The application supports different period types with color-coded badges:

- `theory` - Regular theory classes
- `elective` - Elective courses
- `project` - Project work
- `lab` - Laboratory sessions
- `break` - Break times
- `sp` - Special periods
- `seminar` - Seminar sessions
- `workshop` - Workshop sessions
- `free` - Free periods
- `other` - Other activities
